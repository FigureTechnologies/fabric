Chaincode Tutorials
===================

What is Chaincode?
------------------

Chaincode is a program, written in `Go <https://golang.org>`_, `node.js <https://nodejs.org>`_,
or `Java <https://java.com/en/>`_ that implements a prescribed interface.
Chaincode runs in a secured Docker container isolated from the endorsing peer
process. Chaincode initializes and manages ledger state through transactions
submitted by applications.

A chaincode typically handles business logic agreed to by members of the
network, so it may be considered as a "smart contract". State created by a
chaincode is scoped exclusively to that chaincode and can't be accessed
directly by another chaincode. However, within the same network, given
the appropriate permission a chaincode may invoke another chaincode to
access its state.

Two Personas
------------

We offer two different perspectives on chaincode. One, from the perspective of
an application developer developing a blockchain application/solution
entitled :doc:`chaincode4ade`, and the other, :doc:`chaincode4noah` oriented
to the blockchain network operator who is responsible for managing a blockchain
network, and who would leverage the Hyperledger Fabric API to install and govern
chaincode, but would likely not be involved in the development of a chaincode
application.

Fabric Chaincode Lifecycle
--------------------------

The new Fabric chaincode lifecycle is being introduced as an alpha feature in
Fabric version 2.0. The Fabric chaincode lifecycle is a process that allows
multiple organizations to agree on the parameters of a chaincode before it can
be used to transact on a channel. The new Fabric lifecycle offers several
advantages over the old model.

* **Multiple organizations must agree to a chaincode endorsement policy:** In
  the release 1.x versions of Fabric, one organization had the ability to set a
  chaincode endorsement policy for all other channel members. The new Fabric
  chaincode lifecycle requires a sufficient number of organizations to agree on
  an endorsement policy before it goes into effect. In summary, the chaincode is
  now managed in the scope a of channel.

* **Safer chaincode upgrade process:** The original chaincode lifecycle required
  extensive coordination between organizations to upgrade a chaincode. The
  upgrade transaction was issued by one organization, creating a risk for an
  organization that had not yet installed the new chaincode. The new model
  allows for a chaincode to be upgraded only after a sufficient number of
  organizations approved the upgrade.

* **Easier endorsement policy updates:** Fabric lifecycle allows you to change
  an endorsement policy without having to repackage or reinstall the chaincode.

* **Inspectable chaincode packages:** The Fabric lifecycle packages chaincode in
  easily readable tar files. This makes it easier to inspect the chaincode
  package and coordinate installation across multiple organizations.

* **Start multiple chaincodes on a channel using one package:** The previous
  lifecycle defined each chaincode on the channel using a name and version that
  was specified when the chaincode package was installed. You can now use one
  chaincode package to deploy multiple chaincodes on a channel with different
  names.

.. note:: The Fabric chaincode lifecycle is being introduced as an alpha feature
          in Fabric version 2.0. As a result, some fabric features cannot be
          used with chainodes that use the new Fabric lifecycle:

          - Service Discovery is not supported
          - CouchDB indexes are not supported

          To use the old lifecycle model to install and instantiate a chaincode,
          visit the v1.4 version of the `Chaincode for Operators tutorial <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/chaincode4noah.html>`_

You can use the Fabric chaincode lifecycle by creating a new channel and setting
the channel capabilities to V2_0. You will not be able to use the old lifecycle
to install, instantiate, or update a chaincode on a channels with V2_0 capabilities
enabled. However, you can still invoke chaincode installed using the previous
lifecycle model after you enable V2_0 capabilities. Migration from the previous
lifecycle to the new lifecycle is not supported for the Fabric v2.0 Alpha.
